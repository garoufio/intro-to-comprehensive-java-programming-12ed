/**
 * (Game: bean machine) The bean machine, also known as a quincunx or the Galton box, is a device for statistics
 * experiments named after English scientist Sir Francis Galton. It consists of an upright board with evenly spaced
 * nails (or pegs) in a triangular form. Balls are dropped from the opening of the board. Every time a ball hits a nail,
 * it has a 50% chance of falling to the left or to the right. The piles of balls are accumulated in the slots at the
 * bottom of the board. The program should prompt the user to enter the number of the balls and the number of the slots
 * in the machine. Simulate the falling of each ball by printing its path. Display the final buildup of the balls in
 * the slots in a histogram.
