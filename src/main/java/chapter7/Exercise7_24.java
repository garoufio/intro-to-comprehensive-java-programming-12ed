/**
 * (Simulation: coupon collectorâ€™s problem) Coupon collector is a classic statistics problem with many practical
 * applications. The problem is to repeatedly pick objects from a set of objects and find out how many picks are needed
 * for all the objects to be picked at least once. A variation of the problem is to pick cards from a shuffled deck of
 * 52 cards repeatedly, and find out how many picks are needed before you see one of each suit. Assume a picked card is
 * placed back in the deck before picking another. The  program simulates the number of picks needed to get four cards
 * from each suit and display the four cards picked (it is possible a card may be picked twice).
